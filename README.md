Modurale
========

Modular real time engine for computer graphics.

Requirements
------------

Modurale is written in cross-platform C++ and should compile in Windows, Linux
and Mac environments. Currently it has been tested on Windows only, though.

Dependencies
------------

The following libraries are used. Because of the automated build system there
is no need to manually install them though.
