Modurale
========

Modular real time engine for computer graphics.

Requirements
------------

Modurale is written in cross platform C++ and should compile in Windows, Linux
and Mac environments. Currently it has been tested on Windows only, though.

Dependencies
------------

The following libraries are used. Due to the automated build system, there is
no need to install them though.
